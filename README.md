# FakyBird

FakyBird is an attempt at imitating the game Flappy Bird. For now there are 2 major updates, game.py and game2.py; The first is the original iteration, with no cool graphics, just sounds and movements. It does include a waiting period before starting where you can click "c" to start a cheat mode. The second iteration (game2.py) includes cool graphics and sounds, but doesn't include the cheat mode or the waiting period yet. Future updates will include saving system for previous scores, medals for achievements, a menu and a cheat mode. 
Video for the test run of both updates are up on the link: https://youtu.be/62SHoDkullc

To run the original update you need the following command "python3 game.py". You must download the sounds folder, as well as the gen_nums.py module. You will also need to have installed the pygame module. Flap by pressing "space". To start the game just press "space". The game stops when you lose. At that point you can go back to the waiting section by pressing "m". You may enter the cheat mode by pressing "c" while on the waiting section, you know you're on cheat mode when the bid turns purple. At any point pressing "q" will quit the game. 

To run the second update, you'll need the following command "python3 game2.py". You must download the resources and sounds folders, as well as the gen_num.py module. You will also need to have installed the pygame module. Flap by pressing "space". The game start automatically. There's no way to restart the game yet when you lose (YET!). You may end the game at any point by pressing "q".
